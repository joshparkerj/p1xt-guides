# Computer Science and Programming - Version 4.0

Please read the [FAQ](./faq.md) and note that there are [Tier Project Ideas](./project_ideas.md) to help you select projects.

**Note:** Prior guides have been deprecated but are still available [here](./deprecated/README.md)

## Table of Contents

### Junior developer

I am already employed as a junior developer (or something like that) so I will start with tier 2.

### Intermediate developer

If you want to develop the skills necessary to move beyond junior to intermediate developer - once you've finished tiers X, 0 and 1, proceed to complete tiers 2 and 3.

- [tier 2 - Develop More Expertise](#tier-2---develop-more-expertise)
- [tier 3 - Add More Rigor](#tier-3---add-more-rigor)

### Advanced developer

I'm ignoring the advanced developer content until I complete the intermediate developer content.

### Specializations

Each tier has a 'specialization' based capstone which involves further study and extensive practice in an area of your choosing. [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open](./specializations/app_academy_open.md) is highly recommended (but not required) as the first specialization. Beyond that, feel free to complete a different specialization each tier, or dive deeply into a specialization by selecting it during multiple tiers to explore it in greater detail and further develop your specialized profile.

- [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - App Academy Open](./specializations/app_academy_open.md) (recommended, but not required, first specialization)
- [Web Development - Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development - Full Stack Open 2020](./specializations/full_stack_open_2020.md)
- [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - The Odin Project - Full Stack Ruby on Rails](./specializations/the_odin_project_ruby.md)
- [Web Development - Fullstack Bootcamp - The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript](./specializations/the_odin_project_javascript.md)
- [Web Development - Frontend](./specializations/frontend.md)
- [Web Development - Backend](./specializations/backend.md)
- [Mobile App Development](./specializations/mobile.md)
- [Game Development](./specializations/games.md)
- [Open Source Contributions](./specializations/open_source.md)

### Advanced Specializations

The following specializations rely on knowledge gained in earlier tiers. Additionally, they are typically 'more difficult' or will require more work than those listed above.

- [Computer Science - Algorithms](./specializations/algorithms.md) -Suggested for Tier 2 or later
- [Computer Science - Advanced Algorithms](./specializations/advanced-algorithms.md) - Computer Science - Algorithms is a pre-requisite
- [Computer Science - Intensive](./specializations/computer_science.md) - Suggested for Tier 4 or later
- [Data Science I](./specializations/data-science-i.md) - Suggested for Tier 2 or later
- [Data Science II](./specializations/data-science-ii.md) - Data Science I is a pre-requisite

### Tier Programming Projects

Both tiers and specializations will require 'Tier Programming Projects', you are free to select any programming project you want. To help combat the 'but I don't know what I want' roadblock, [Tier Programming Project Ideas](./project_ideas.md) lists a variety of ideas.

**Note:** In specializations, the Tier Programming Projects might have extra criteria (such as 'if you're doing a mobile app development specialization your projects must be mobile apps')


## Intermediate Developer

### Tier 2 - Develop More Expertise

Dive deeper into the Computer Science topics which will prove useful throughout all programming
